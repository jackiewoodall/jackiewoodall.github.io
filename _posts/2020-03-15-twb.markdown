 "An Overview of Spiritual Practices" by William Mikulas.<p>
 This is an out-of-print book made freely available online with the author's knowledge. This book is offered for free distribution. Please do not sell this book.<p>
 This is a book about what you should do, not about what you should believe. What you should do if you wish to maximize your potential; satisfy your basic yearnings; have peak experiences. To accomplish all this, the author provides a practical overview of five spiritual practices to be used as guidelines: meditation, concentration, mindfulness, opening the heart, and reducing attachments.<p>
